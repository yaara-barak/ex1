This project deals with modeling data structures and algorithms on graphs that are weighted and undirected such as:
1. building a graph
2. calculating the shorts route between two vertexes
3. testing to see if the graph is connected 
4. deep copying of the graph
5. save the graph on a file
6. load a graph from given file
This project was created within an educational study in the OOP course at Ariel University
