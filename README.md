This project deals with modeling data structures and algorithms on graphs that are weighted and undirected such as:
1. Building a graph.
2. Calculating the shorts route between two vertexes.
3. Testing to see if the graph is connected.
4. Deep copying of the graph.
5. Save the graph on a file.
6. Load a graph from a given file.
This project was created within an educational study in the OOP course at Ariel University.
